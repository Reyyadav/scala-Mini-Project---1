## Furtune Game 

### -The Player will be given 5 Turns to guess a number lets say "X"
### -After Each Attempt Your Program will do:-
#### -If the player's entered number is less than the actual number X then show the output the player that his guess is less than the actual number X and show him the remaining guess out of 5.
#### -If the player's entered number is Greater than the actual number X then show the output the player that his guess is Greater than the actual number X and show him the remaining guess out of 5.
#### -If he has no tries left show output message player lost the GAME and show him the number X.
#### -If players entered number is equal to X then show output that he won and shoe him th number of tries taken.
### -The Number X will be Between - 0 to 100.
